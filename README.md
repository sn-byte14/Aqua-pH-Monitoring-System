#ðŸŒŠ Aqua pH Monitoring System

#ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Aqua pH Monitoring System is an Arduino-based water quality monitoring system designed to measure and monitor the pH levels of water in real-time. It uses a pH sensor to detect the acidity or alkalinity of water and displays the readings on an LCD screen. This system is beneficial for applications such as:

Aquaculture â€“ Monitoring water pH for fish farming.

Agriculture â€“ Ensuring soil and water pH suitability.

Drinking Water Quality â€“ Checking for contamination.
